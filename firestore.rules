/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the transport app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a multi-tenant security model. Data is partitioned by `companyId`, and users must be authenticated to access any data.
 * All data access is scoped to the company level.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profile information, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Stores company-specific data.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores client information for a company.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/origins/{originId}: Stores shipment origins for a company.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/clients/{clientId}/addresses/{addressId}: Stores addresses for a specific client.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/orders/{orderId}: Stores order information for a company.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict User Ownership:  User profiles are only accessible to the authenticated user.
 * - Multi-Tenant Enforcement: All company-related data is scoped under the /companies/{companyId} path and is accessible only to authenticated users (in future implementations, roles will be created).
 * - No User Listing: Listing all users is not permitted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - Company ID: It is assumed that the application code ensures that companyId is present in relevant documents, enabling easy authorization checks.
