/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the transport app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a multi-tenant security model based on company IDs.
 * Users have implicit ownership over their profiles. Companies own all data
 * associated with them (clients, orders, drivers, etc.).  No listing of users
 * is allowed for privacy.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profile information.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/...: All company-related data is nested under
 *   the company ID.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/clients/{clientId}: Client data.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/orders/{orderId}: Order data.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/drivers/{driverId}: Driver data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are readable/writable only by the owning user.
 * - Company data is only accessible within the scope of the company. There are no global administrator roles.
 * - Listing user documents is disallowed.
 * - Data shape validation is relaxed in prototyping mode, focusing on authorization.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The company ID is embedded within documents nested under /companies/{companyId}
 *   to simplify and secure access control.  This prevents needing to do a `get()`
 *   operation to validate the company ID on nested documents.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data is stored under /users/{userId}, separate from public
 *   collections.
