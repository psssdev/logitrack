/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a multi-tenant data model where data is primarily segmented by `companyId`.
 * Users can only access data belonging to their company. Strong ownership is enforced for user profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profile information; access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/...:  All company-related data (clients, origins, addresses) is stored under a company-specific path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users cannot list all users in the database.
 * - Clients, Origins, and Addresses are scoped to a company and accessible only to authenticated users.
