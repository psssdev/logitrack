/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the transport app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a multi-tenant model where data is segregated by company.
 * Users can only access data within their assigned company.
 * Strict ownership is enforced for user profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profile information.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores client data for a specific company.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/origins/{originId}: Stores shipment origin points for a specific company.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/clients/{clientId}/addresses/{addressId}: Stores addresses for a specific client.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Only authenticated users can access company-specific data.
 * - Listing of clients and origins is allowed only within a company's scope.
 * - Data validation is minimized to focus on authorization and relational integrity, allowing for rapid prototyping.
 * - All write operations require authentication.
