/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the transport app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a multi-tenant security model. Data is segregated by company,
 * and users must be authenticated to access any data.  All write operations are
 * restricted to authenticated users, with additional constraints to ensure data
 * integrity and prevent unauthorized modifications.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profile information.
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Stores company-specific data.
 *   - /companies/{companyId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores clients for a company.
 *   - /companies/{companyId}/origins/{originId}: Stores shipment origins for a company.
 *   - /companies/{companyId}/clients/{clientId}/addresses/{addressId}: Stores addresses for a company's client.
 *   - /companies/{companyId}/orders/{orderId}: Stores orders for a company.
 *   - /companies/{companyId}/drivers/{driverId}: Stores drivers for a company.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent unauthorized access to user information.
 * - Company-level data access requires authentication.  No public access is granted.
 * - Data consistency is enforced for user-scoped data (e.g., userId in /users/{userId} must match the authenticated user's UID).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  This ruleset relies on path-based authorization.  For instance, access to orders
 *  is determined by the company ID in the path.  No denormalization is explicitly used
 *  in this version, but it's crucial to consider it in future iterations, especially
 *  for complex relationships or roles within a company.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  The app uses separate collections for user profiles and company-related data. This ensures
 *  that user data is isolated and access to company data is controlled separately.
