/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a multi-tenant security model where users can only access data within their company.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profile information. Accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores client information, scoped to a company. Access is restricted to authenticated users.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/origins/{originId}: Stores shipment origins, scoped to a company. Access is restricted to authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Data access is predicated on the user being authenticated.
 * - All write operations require explicit authentication and authorization.
