/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a multi-tenant data model where data is segregated by company.
 * All data is nested under /companies/{companyId} to provide isolation.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: Strict user-ownership and company-based multi-tenancy are enforced.
 * Data access is generally restricted to authenticated users and further limited by company ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only by the user.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/...: Company-specific data, accessible to company members (not implemented yet).
 *   - /clients/{clientId}: Clients of a specific company.
 *   - /origins/{originId}: Origins (shipping locations) for a specific company.
 *   - /clients/{clientId}/addresses/{addressId}: Addresses for a specific client within a company.
 *   - /orders/{orderId}: Orders for a specific company.
 * - /drivers/{driverId}: Drivers for a specific company.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 * - Currently, there's no concept of "company members" or roles.  Access to company data is implicitly granted. This should be refined in future iterations.
